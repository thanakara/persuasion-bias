       "\n",
       "1. Addiction and decreased attention span\n",
       "2. Increased risk of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem\n",

       "4. Exposure to inappropriate content and online harassment\n",

However, it relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and general statements, which may not be sufficient to convince all readers. Additionally, the argument does not provide a clear, evidence-based solution to the problem, which might make it less convincing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bias Analysis:**\n",
       "The argument exhibits a slight bias towards the negative aspects of social media and its impact on youth. While it acknowledges some potential benefits of social media, such as online connections and learning opportunities, the text primarily focuses on the potential risks. This might lead readers to perceive the argument as overly critical of social media and its effects on youth.\n",

       "1. Providing more concrete, evidence-based data to support the claims about the negative effects of social media on youth.\n",
       "2. Offering a more nuanced discussion of the potential benefits of social media, such as online connections and learning opportunities.\n",
       "3. Presenting a more balanced view of the issue, acknowledging both the potential risks and benefits of social media.\n",
       "\n",
